In this repo you can see 3 of the projects I made during my internship for "Strypes". 
Here I've used Inheritance, Encapsulation, Abstraction, Dynamic and Static Polyporphism, Cmake etc...

If you want to run any of the projects - make a local folder 'build' for the desired program.
Navigate to the folder and run the following commands:
1) cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" ..
2) mingw32-make
